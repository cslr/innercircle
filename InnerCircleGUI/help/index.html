<h2>Inner Circle help file</h2>

<p>Inner Circle uses AES-256 bit encryption which can be used to encrypt files or text messages. Encrypted data is stored as a Base64 ASCII encoded data. 
It is meant to encrypt small files and messages as the methods load all file data to memory before processing it.

<h3>File Encryption</h3>

<p>To encrypt files you first select a file to be encrypted and write a passprase and then click the "Encrypt file" button. 
This generates file in the same direcory with a ".encrypted" extension. The files can be decrypted similarly by selecting crypted file, 
writing a passphrase and by clicking the "Decrypt file" button.

<h3>Message Encryption</h3>

<p>To encrypt messages you first write a passphrase and then select the "Encrypt message.." button. This will generate ASCII encoded block of data into
the message box which can be cut'n'pasted and send over insecure channel to the recipient. To decrypt message write the passphrase and 
select the "Decrypt message.." button. Then cut'n'paste ASCII data block into the window and decipher the message.

<h3>AES-512 Encryption</h3>

<p>The software extends secure AES-256 bit encryption by using it twice to data. This means there are two 256 bit keys which are created using the 
SHA 512 bit message digest of a passphrase. Encrypted data is also compressed before processing it through encryption algorithms.

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Encryption algorithm's should give pretty good security but software expects that Operating System is by itself secure. The encryption of files don't delete 
the original file which should be done through operating system so that it cannot be retrieved anymore (encrypted file system). Additionally, memory can be 
swapped to disk which may make it possible to read original messages or passphrases. The software doesn't use public key encryption because quantum computers 
can break RSA and some other public key ciphers while AES-256 (or non-standard AES-512) should be secure as long as passwords are not leaked.
